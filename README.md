### Lesson Plan: Collaborating on GitHub Repositories

**Objective:**  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Create and collaborate on a shared GitHub repository.  
2. Follow a simple Git workflow for group projects.  
3. Understand roles and responsibilities within the team.  

---

### 1. **Setting Up the Collaborative Repository**
1. **Choose a Repository Manager**:  
   - One person (the "Manager") creates the repository on GitHub.  
   - The Manager shares the repository link with the team.  

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   - Everyone on the team clones the repository to their local computer using:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

3. **Branching Rules**:  
   - Everyone creates their own branch to work on.  
   - Name the branch as `name-feature`, for example, `nabila-index` or `ali-update-form`.  
   - Use this command to create and switch to your branch:  
     ```bash
     git checkout -b name-feature
     ```

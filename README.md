# Collaborating on GitHub Repositories

**Objective:**  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Create and collaborate on a shared GitHub repository.  
2. Follow a simple Git workflow for group projects.  
3. Understand roles and responsibilities within the team.  

---

### 1. **Set Up the Collab Repo**
1. **Choose a Repo Manager**:  
   - One person (Manager) creates the repository on GitHub.  
   - The Manager shares the repository link with the team.  

2. **Clone the Repo**:  
   - Everyone clones the repo to their computer using:
     ```bash
     git clone <repo-url>
     ```

3. **Branching Rules**:  
   - Everyone creates their own branch to work on.  
   - Name the branch `name-feature`, for example, `nabila-index` or `ali-update-form`.  
   - Use this command to create your branch:  
     ```bash
     git checkout -b name-feature
     ```
